This repository contains the Gym Website page for Web Applications Development project.
Our project was supposed to compressed in Zip files and hence the  zip folder named G00376320.7z has all my files in it.
## What is inside my files?
  After downloading the zip folder, extract the files from it. 
  I have created 4 HTML pages named login.html, timetable.html, contact.html, statistics.html
       
       Timetable.html – Shows the timetable for the gym.
	     Statistics.html –Shows the Bar chart Graphs done using data from class.csv and an array of data. Implemented with DOM and svg.              Contact.html – Takes in user information like name, email, contact number and query.
	     Login.html – Takes the login details of existing members in the gym mainly to book classes.
